			<p> One of her favourite hobbies is <b> cooking </b> and she loves it! Before she goes to work, she prepares pasta, lasagna or even seafood; it's so relaxing for her that she forgets that once she finishes her tasty dishes, the sad part comes...doing the washing up. <br/> 
			<p> Another one is <b> watching movies, </b> she enjoys watching them in her room so if she need to go out because friends invited her for dinner, she can pause it and continue watching it when she comes back. Her favourite genres are: <i> Comedy, Action and Drama. </i> <br/> </p>
			<p> Last but not least, she also has a great time <b> running </b>. She goes to a park near her house where she runs there three times a week for 30 or 20 minutes -it depends on her mood. While she runs, she fancies listening to music from playlists on Spotify. </p>

			<p> Her passion is travelling no matter where as far as she spends an amazing time relaxing, visiting landscapes or going on incredible adventures. Some of her friends love to travel too, so as soon as they get the idea what city or country they want to visit next, they tell start making plans and decide how and when they are going to go. She adores trying typical food, meeting new people from different regions or countries and if it's possible, practise either English or French with them. This year, she's planning to visit San Luis Potosi and Coahuila. </p>
